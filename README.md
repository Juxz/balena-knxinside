# balena-knxinside

This repo is an attempt to run KNX Inside application inside a BalenaCloud container for raspberrypi4 platform
It is absolutely not working at the moment, but I share my work in progress in case it could be helpful to anyone.

To run this docker, you will need to download ets-inside application from KNX Association website : http://my.knx.org/en/downloads/software . A (free) account has to be created.
